Testing the correct behaviour of product administration.  

## The aim of the tests
The different Features are divided into various .feature files starting with a number which states the order of test execution.  
The name of the file usually describes what is being tested and is further specified in the Feature of the file.  
The tested features are viewing, creating, editing and deleting products.  
Every Scenario represents one test case that tries to check the correct behaviour.  
Tests try to cover the basic activities needed when managing the products in an online store.
Every test scenario is described as simple as it can be so it should be understood by anyone,  thus I dont feel the need  
of further explanation.
